A [Django] web API for climate change related data inspired by [no one giving a fuck].

[Django]: https://www.djangoproject.com/
[no one giving a fuck]: http://titojankowski.com/no-one-gives-a-fck-about-climate-change/

From [Carbon Doomsday: Tracking CO2 since 1958]:

[Carbon Doomsday: Tracking CO2 since 1958]: http://datadrivenjournalism.net/featured_projects/carbon_doomsday_tracking_co2_since_1958

> Carbon Doomsday is a real-time API and chart of worldwide carbon dioxide
> levels. Developed as a community project, its goal is to be an open-source
> platform for climate data. Data for the API and chart comes from NOAAâ€™s Earth
> System Research Lab in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The project is rooted in principles
> of free software, open data access and a willingness to contribute to further
> education on the global climate issue.

Check out [carbondoomsday.com], (powered by [carbon-inferno]) our CO2 emissions tracker, which consumes this web API.

Please see the [Swagger API documentation] to get started.

The service is currently hosted on the Heroku free tier. Response times may vary.

This is a community driven project which aims to bring all levels of
contributor to engage in providing a reliable, [free] and feature packed web
API. Please see the [contribution documentation] if you'd like to help out.
